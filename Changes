0.02_03 Wed Feb 2 2005
	- If a report grade couldn't be determined, then the DB was
	  recording this as 'unknown'. However, seeing as this a valid
	  report grade, this has been changed to 'ungraded'.
	- Fixed bugs in send reporting - if a module had been tested and
	  the DB had 'ungraded', a subsequent pass/fail/na/unknown wasn't 
	  being recorded. Should be able to override grades for 
	  ungraded/unknown/none. Should be able to override a fail grade
	  with a pass.
	- Fixed bugs in audit & plugin reporting.
	- Settings passed to CPANPLUS::Configure now handled correctly.
	- Reduced object overhead by not using mark() in test(), but
	  accessing the tied DB directly.
	- created private methods _track and _debug to better handle
	  messages to STDOUT and audit file.
	- Added new plugin, SmokeDB, to access the contents of the current
	  local cpansmoke DB.
	- Added standard regex for supported archive extensions.
	- Added support for an audit callback handler.

0.02_02 Mon Jan 31 2005
	- Move NNTP.pm to NNTPWeb.pm and created a NNTP.pm plugin that
	  uses Net::NNTP.
	- added excluded() function to list the distributions that would
	  be excluded from testing.
	- added a parameter to download_list(). If set to 1 it implies a
	  test run is in progress.
	- added more audit trail printing.
	- fixed a few bugs in previous development version.
	- added a cpansmoke.pl script.

0.02_01 Fri Jan 25 2005
        - added POD and more tests.
        - added plugin capability to be more flexible about where to
          get the recent distribution lists.
        - added more configuration support including an audit_log and
          config_file settings.
        - set $ENV{'AUTOMATED_TESTING'} = 1, which if adopted by others
          will hopefully enable CPAN authors to detect if their
          distribution is being tested by a machine or a human.

0.02  Sun Jan 23 2005
        - added option to exclude distros based on regexes

        - various code comments/tweaks
        - some messages only shown when verbose is set
