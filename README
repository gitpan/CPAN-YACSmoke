NAME
    CPAN::YACSmoke - Yet Another CPAN Smoke Tester

SYNOPSIS
      perl -MCPAN::YACSmoke -e test

REQUIREMENTS
    This package requires the following modules (most of which are not
    included with Perl):

      CPANPLUS
      Config::IniFiles
      File::Basename
      File::HomeDir
      File::Path
      File::Spec
      IO::File
      LWP::Simple
      Module::Pluggable
      Regexp::Assemble
      SDBM_File
      Sort::Versions
      Test::Reporter
      URI

   These dependencies (such as CPANPLUS and Test::Reporter) may require
   additional modules.

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the backend of CPANPLUS to run tests on modules
    recently uploaded to CPAN and post results to the CPAN Testers list.

    See the module documentation for more information.

CAVEATS
    This is a proto-type release. Use with caution and supervision.

    The current version has a very primitive interface and limited
    functionality. Future versions may have a lot of options.

    There is always a risk associated with automatically downloading and
    testing code from CPAN, which could turn out to be malicious or severely
    buggy. Do not run this on a critical machine.

    This module uses the backend of CPANPLUS to do most of the work, so is
    subject to any bugs of CPANPLUS.

    And yes, it's sorely in need of documentation.
